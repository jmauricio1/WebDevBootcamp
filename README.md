# Some things to remember from this course

## **REMEMBER THIS**
> "I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying. One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree â€” make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to."

> Don't be too ambitious at first.

> It's not shameful to google things.

> You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Some wheels were made for you to do great things it.

## Web Design 
- People recognize design more than functionality
- 3 seconds to make a good impression"
- 4 Pillars of Good Web Design
    - Color Theory
    - Typography
    - UI Design
    - UX Design

#### Color Theory
- mood: predominant color (different colors bring different feelings)
- Analogous Color Patterns: not good at standing out
- Complimentary palettes: make things pop

#### Typography
- Most developers use two fonts in one design that portray similar moods

#### UI Design
- Size/Height = Heirarchy
- Accent Tones: things you want people to pay attention to
- Optimal line length: 40 to 60 characters per line
- Alignment: consistency is key and try to reduce the number of alignment points

#### UX Design
- meant to be invisible
- make this effortless for the user
- Keep things simple
- "F" reading pattern
- "Z" reading pattern
- Think about all platform design (desktop and mobile)
- **Get rid of banners and warnings** (They make things cluttered)

#### Whitespace
- make things look expensive and elevated

#### Audience
- pay attention to your audience and think of what they would want

## HTML & CSS
- meta tags make things available for search engines to find and use to display
- `position: absolute;` is relative to its parents; can cause unnatural flow of elements/page
- `position: relative;` is relative to the current position (where it should have been)
- `margin: auto;` is good for centering things if `text-align: center;` is not being used
- use web-safe fonts (but really, no font is 100% web-safe)
- em: width of the capital letter 'M'
    - **16px = 100% = 1em**
- rem: ignore parents em and just set it to a absolute em
- dynamic `font-size` = better accessibility
